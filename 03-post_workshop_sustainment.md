### Digital Scholarship meetups
Software Carpentry workshops have become an avenue for raising awareness for services and support the University Libaries can provide. At the University of Oklahoma, we have offered a Digital Scholarship Meetupa every Thursday afternoon for almost two years. 

### User group meetings 
Ran a R User Group for a few months at OU that was well attended by
past-workshop participants.

### Other models
